# Contribution Guidelines

- Any changes should be done in its own branch (`feature/log-caching` for a log caching feature, for example)
- When the feature is "ready" make a PR to merge `feature/log-caching` into `master`.
 - If you make additional changes, push new commits to your branch. Do not squash your changes, that makes it extremely hard to see what youâ€™ve changed compared to the previous version of your pull request.
- Ensure that the PR works as intended on staging.
- When the feature has been checked and verified to be fixed/complete, PR to merge `master` into `www1-stable`. Be sure to specify if any new parameters are required to be filled when deploying.
