            <p>
                One of the services provided by the IRC bot is the <em>logging</em> of your channel, be it publicly or privately.
                These logs are then used to generate channel statistics. The logs themselves are neatly organized and can easily be browsed within our website.

            <h2 class="commands-header">Commands</h2>
            <p>
                Another service provided by the IRC bot is the ability to create factoid commands on the fly. 
                Allowing for easy and flexible creation of responses based on frequently asked questions, and even listen for certain triggers to have it respond automatically.

            <h2 class="stats-header">Stats</h2>
            <p>
                Statistics are generated based off of the logs collected by the IRC bot. 
                We are able to generate statistics to accurately capture who is the most active person by hours,
                along with other things like whom uses the most smileys, who has been granted the most karma, and which person can make sailors blush with their vulgar language.
